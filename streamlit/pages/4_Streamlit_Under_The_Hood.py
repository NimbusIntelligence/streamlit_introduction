                Streamlit apps are Python scripts that run from top to bottom, which brings two major challenges:
        
                1. Long-running functions run again and again, which slows down your app.
                2. Objects get recreated again and again, which makes it hard to persist them across reruns or sessions.

                Streamlit solves these problems with two caching decorators!
